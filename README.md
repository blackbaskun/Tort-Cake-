# Tort-Cake- is a simple C++ code that contains class, a few constructors, and other basic functions.
Firstly, I created class Tort (Cake), which includes the name, cake flavor list and number of flavors. In public, I created 4 different constructors and one destructor. 
Subsequent constructors need more and more information about the cake.

Function Add allows you to enter the flavor you want to include in the list. However you need to check if list is not full for this I created function that tests if the number of flavors is less than 30.
There is of cours function for delating all flavors or the last one added. You can check if list is empty using function. Finaly you can print all needed info about cake and check how many cakes exists.
