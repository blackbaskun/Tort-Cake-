# Tort-Cake- is a simple C++ code that contains class, a few constructors, and other basic functions.
Firstly, I created class Tort (Cake), which includes the name, cake flavor list and number of flavors. In public, I created 4 different constructors and one destructor. 
Subsequent constructors need more and more information about the cake.
